# Get Started

## Install

This tutorial assumes that you have installed Sceptre. Instructions on how to
do this can be found in the section on [installing Sceptre]({{ site.url }}{{
site.baseurl }}/docs/install.html).

## Directory Structure

Sceptre provides a quick and easy way to setup a Sceptre project with the
`sceptre new` command.

To setup a fresh project run:

```shell
$ sceptre new project my-sceptre-project

Please enter a region []:
Please enter a project_code [my-sceptre-project]:
```

This will produce the following directory structure:

```shell
tree
.
my-sceptre-project
    ├── config
    │   └── config.yaml
    └── templates
```

The `config` directory is where you will keep the configuration for your Stacks
and the `templates` directory is where you will keep your CloudFormation
templates.

Lets add our first template and stack config. We are going to create
a `StackGroup` (directory) called `dev` and setup a Stack with a single `VPC`
in it.

On \*nix systems:

```
$ mkdir config/dev
$ touch config/dev/config.yaml config/dev/vpc.yaml templates/vpc.json
```

`vpc.json` will contain a CloudFormation template, `vpc.yaml` will contain
config relevant to that template, and `config.yaml` will contain environment
config.

### Our First Template - vpc.json

Add the following CloudFormation to `vpc.json`:

```json
{
  "Parameters": {
    "CidrBlock": {
      "Type": "String"
    }
  },
  "Resources": {
    "VPC": {
      "Type": "AWS::EC2::VPC",
      "Properties": {
        "CidrBlock": {
          "Ref": "CidrBlock"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "Outputs": {
    "VpcId": {
      "Value": {
        "Ref": "VPC"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For more information on CloudFormation, see the AWS documentation on
[CloudFormation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html).

### Our First StackGroup config - config.yaml

Add the following configuration to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
project_code: sceptre-example
region: eu-west-1
```

Sceptre prefixes stack names with the `project_code`. All resources in this
StackGroup will be built in the AWS region `region`.

### Our First Stack config - vpc.yaml

Add the following configuration to `vpc.yaml`:

```yaml
template_path: vpc.json
parameters:
  CidrBlock: 10.0.0.0/16
```

`template_path` specifies the relative path to the CloudFormation, Python or
Jinja2 template to use to launch the Stack. Sceptre will use the `templates`
directory as the root templates directory to base your `template_path` from.

`parameters` lists the parameters which are supplied to the template
`vpc.json`.

You should now have a Sceptre project that looks a bit like:

```
tree
.
├── config
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── dev
│       ├── config.yaml
│       └── vpc.yaml
└── templates
    └── vpc.json
```

> Note: You do not need to make sure the Template and Stack config names
> match, since you define the `template_path` in your Stack config, but it can
> be useful to keep track of what is going on.

You will also notice that we have two `config.yaml` files, one in `config/` and
the other in `config/dev`. We will explain this later but Sceptre will
eventually merge these two files when generating the overall config file where
values from the child configs replace the parent (unless otherwise specified).

## Commands

### Create stack

We can create the VPC Stack with the following command:

```shell
$ sceptre create dev/vpc.yaml
```

This command must be run from the `my-sceptre-project` directory.

### Meta commands

We can find out information about our running stack:

```shell
$ sceptre list resources dev
$ sceptre list resources dev/vpc.yaml
$ sceptre --ignore-dependencies list outputs dev/vpc.yaml
```

### Update stack

If the Stack's config or Template is changed in `vpc.yaml`, the Stack can be
updated with:

```shell
$ sceptre update dev/vpc.yaml
```

### Delete stack

Delete the stack:

```shell
$ sceptre delete dev/vpc.yaml
```

## Next Steps

We have created our first Sceptre project, added a Template and Stack config
and used the CLI to create, update and delete the Stack. You can find a full
reference to the CLI [in our CLI guide]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/docs/cli.html)
