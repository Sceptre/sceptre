How do I set AWS Region or Profile via the CLI?
-----------------------------------------------

These configuration items, and others, can be set from the CLI using
:ref:`templating <stack_group_config_templating>`. The syntax for setting the AWS region is presented below. The
syntax for replacing the other items is the same, with the word ``region``
substituted out.

In config.yaml:

.. code-block:: yaml

   region: {{ var.region }}

On the CLI:

.. code-block:: text

    sceptre --var "region=<your region name>" COMMAND

Should I use a Parameter or Sceptre User Data?
----------------------------------------------

Parameters are the standard way of passing StackGroup-specific configuration to
a CloudFormation template. They offer:

-  Native support from CloudFormation
-  A high degree of customisability, as described in the `AWS documentation`_

However, parameters suffer from the following limitation:

-  They cannot alter the template based on the parameter value

Sceptre user data was added to fix this limitation. It is configuration that is
passed directly to a template, and so can be used to change the template based
on the configuration itemâ€™s value.

For example, if the Sceptre user data item ``number_of_azs`` is passed to a
subnet tier template, the value could be used to create different numbers of
subnets. This cannot be done with native parameters.

In general, native CloudFormation parameters should be used in almost all
cases. Sceptre user data should only be used when the user wants to alter the
template based on the value of a config value.

Why are there two ways to supply environment variables in stack config files?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to replace values in stack config files with environment
variables in two ways.

The first is by using templating, and the syntax
``{{ environment_variable.VALUE }}``. Any value in a
config file may be replaced using this method.

The second is by using a resolver, and the syntax:

.. code-block:: yaml

   parameters:
     param_1: !environment_variable VALUE

This second syntax is only able to replace parameter values.

The difference between these two methods lies in when the value of the
environment variable is obtained. The templating method obtains the environment
variable when Sceptre is first invoked. The resolver method obtains the
environment variable just before the operations ``create``, ``update``,
``launch`` operation is executed (Note that these are the only commands which
require parameters). This difference becomes most apparent with the use of the
``launch`` command. As multiple stacks are launched, early stacks can set
environment variables (using Hooks) which can then be read in by later stacks.
This is only possible using resolvers.

In order to use environment variables set by Hooks run by a stack previously
built in the same ``launch`` command, the environment variable resolver must be
used.

My CI/CD process uses ``sceptre launch``. How do I delete stacks that aren't needed anymore?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the ``launch`` command is a very useful "1-stop-shop" to apply changes from Stack Configs,
creating stacks that don't exist and updating stacks that do exist. This makes it a very useful
command to configure your CI/CD system to invoke. However, sometimes you need to delete a stack that
isn't needed anymore and you want this automatically applied by the same process.

This "clean up" is complicated by the fact that Sceptre doesn't know anything that isn't in its
Stack and StackGroup Configs; If you delete a Stack Config, Sceptre won't know to clean it up.

Therefore, the way to accomplish this "clean up" operation is to perform the change in 3 steps:

1. First, add ``obsolete: True`` to the Stack Config(s) you want to clean up.
   For more information on ``obsolete``, see the :ref:`Stack Config entry on it<obsolete>`.
2. Update your CI/CD process to run ``sceptre launch --prune`` instead of ``sceptre launch``. This
   will cause all stacks marked as obsolete to be deleted going forward.
3. Once your CI/CD process has cleaned up all the obsolete stacks, delete the local Stack Config files
   you marked as obsolete in step 1, since the stacks they create have all been deleted.

.. note::

   Using ``obsolete: True`` will not work if any other stacks depend on that stack that are
   not themselves obsolete. Attempting to prune any obsolete stacks that are depended on by
   non-obsolete stacks will result in Sceptre immediately failing the launch.
