Installation
============

This assumes that you have Python installed. A thorough guide on
installing Python can be found
`here <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`__.
We highly recommend using Sceptre from within a ``virtualenv``. Notes on
installing and setting up ``virtualenv`` can be found
`here <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`__.

Install Sceptre:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install sceptre

Validate installation by printing out Sceptre's version number:

.. code:: shell

    $ sceptre --version
    Sceptre, version <x.x.x>

Update Sceptre:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install sceptre -U
