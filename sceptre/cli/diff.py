    """Indicates the difference between the currently DEPLOYED stacks in the command path and
    the stacks configured in Sceptre right now. This command will compare both the templates as well
    as the subset of stack configurations that can be compared. By default, only stacks that would
    be launched via the launch command will be diffed, but you can diff ALL stacks relevant to the
    passed command path if you pass the --all flag.

    Some settings (such as sceptre_user_data) are not available in a CloudFormation stack
    description, so the diff will not be indicated. Currently compared stack configurations are:

    \b
      * parameters
      * notifications
      * cloudformation_service_role
      * stack_tags

    Important: There are resolvers (notably !stack_output) that rely on other stacks
    to be already deployed when they are resolved. When producing a diff on Stack Configs that have
    such resolvers that point to non-deployed stacks, this presents a challenge, since this means
    those resolvers cannot be resolved. This particularly applies to stack parameters and when a
    stack's template uses sceptre_user_data with resolvers in it. In order to continue to be useful
    when producing a diff in these conditions, this command will do the following:

    1. If the resolver CAN be resolved, it will be resolved and the resolved value will be in the
    diff results.
    2. If the resolver CANNOT be resolved, it will be replaced with a string that represents the
    resolver and its arguments. For example: !stack_output my_stack.yaml::MyOutput will resolve in
    the parameters to "{ !StackOutput(my_stack.yaml::MyOutput) }".

    Particularly in cases where the replaced value doesn't work in the template as the template logic
    requires and causes an error, there is nothing further Sceptre can do and diffing will fail.
