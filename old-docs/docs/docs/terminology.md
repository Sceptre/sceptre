# Terminology

The following terms will be used though the rest of the Sceptre documentation:

- **Environment Path**: A slash ('/') separated list of directory names which details how to move from the top level config directory to an environment directory. For example, with the following directory structure, the environment path would simply be `dev`:

    ```
    .
    └── config
        └── dev
            ├── config.yaml
            └── vpc.yaml
    ```


  In the following directory structure, the environment path would be `account-1/dev/eu-west-1`:

    ```
    .
    └── config
        └── account-1
            └── dev
                └── eu-west-1
                    ├── config.yaml
                    └── vpc.yaml
    ```

- **Launch**: In the context of Sceptre commands, `launch` means to try to `create` a stack. If the stack has already been created, Sceptre tries to `update` the stack. If there are no updates to be performed, `launch` returns a zero exit code.
- **Sceptre Directory**: The directory which stores the top level config directory.
