# Contributed Software

The scripts included in this sub-tree are intended to provide end users
a convenient way to find useful projects that extend Sceptre. The tools found
here are not guaranteed to be maintained by the core Sceptre team. As such if
you have feature requests or bugs with these scripts you should contact the
author/maintainer.


# Adding Your Project

To add your tool or script to contrib/ follow the normal CONTRIBUTING guide. In
addition to the steps outlined in CONTRIBUTING you should:

- Contain your project in it's own directory.

- Within your project's contrib/ directory add a readme file, README.md

- Your README should contain information about the project such as why it
exists and how to "install" and use it. Provide any other useful information
and if examples would help then try to include these as well.

An example contrib project is structured as follows:

```
contrib/

    your-project/

            README.md

            your-main-script.extension
```
