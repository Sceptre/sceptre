# The idea with this workflow is to allow users to trigger an integration test
# run from a PR however it doesn't work because github action does not allow
# access to the github token when triggered from a PR.  The workflow fails with..
# "Credentials could not be loaded, please check your action inputs: Could not load credentials from any providers"
